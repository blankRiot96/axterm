## What is Axterm?
Axterm is a two-in-one terminal, which contains both a virtual console and gui terminal meant to be used side by side. <br>
It was made as a submission for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-tool-jam-3">Tool Jam 3</a>.

## Should I use Axterm?
Axterm was not made as a replacement for whatever it is you are using currently. If you fancy a different experience, something that's unique, maybe it's the choice for you. <br>
There is no gaurentee that functionality wise Axterm is better than the standard options, if you are someone who relies heavily on the terminal for a lot of tasks, maybe it's not the best bet for you.

## Where can I install it?
Axterm can be installed from its <a href="https://blankRiot96.itch.io/axterm">Itch page</a>.
